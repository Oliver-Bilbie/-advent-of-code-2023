# Advent of Code 2023
Some solutions to [advent of code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023).

Initially I set out to get some experience with Go, which I had previously never used. I was impressed by how easy the language was to pick up and its general simplicity, although I don't currently see a place for it in my toolbox since it fills a gap between high and low level languages which I do not personally spend much time in. Later days have switched back to Rust.
