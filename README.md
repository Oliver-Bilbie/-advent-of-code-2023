# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code ðŸŽ„

Solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) programming challenges for various years.

## How to run the examples
### Input files
The challenges depend on a specific puzzle input provided alongside each task.
This repository expects these files to be available in the location `/year/day_n/input.txt` however the creator has asked kindly that these files not be committed. As such you will need to provide your own puzzle inputs. From 2024 onwards, I have provided tests to run the publicly available example input through the solution. You may run the tests for any challenge to see the code in action without providing a puzzle input.

### Rust
- **To run the solution:** navigate to the directory `/year/day_n/task_m/` and run the command `cargo run --release`.
- **To run the tests:** navigate to the directory `/year/day_n/task_m/` and run the command `cargo test`.

### Go
- To run the solution, navigate to the directory `/year/day_n/` and run the command `go run task_m.go`.
